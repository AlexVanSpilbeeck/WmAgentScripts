\begin{abstract}
The main objective of the CMS central computing operations is to run and monitor the simulation and data reconstruction workflows maximizing the throughput while making an efficient use of all the computing resources. Running the central workflows presented itself as a changing and challenging task as the conditions, tools  and manpower varied during the first run of data taking.

In this report we present the way in which running this workflows evolved with the needs of the CMS. This will include how we evolved from the first framework tool ProdAgent to the actual WMAgent, the change in the grid infrastructure submission, from GLite to GlideIn and finally the organization of the procedures around the Workflow Team. We will end up with the biggest achievements the team made during the first run of data taking our actual setup and the future challenges that we will meet in the second run as well as the expected solutions.
